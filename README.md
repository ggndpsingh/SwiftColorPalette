# How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, follow these steps:
- Update the `Colors.json` file with any new colors or update any existing colors.
- Open terminal & navigate to the project directory path.
- Run `./main.swift` (This will add/update the asset catalogue with the changes to `Color.json`).
- For now you will need to manaually update the `UIColor+Colors` file, to make the changes availabe as a `UIColor` extension.
- Commit your changes and create a PR.
